#DL4xD-Reasoner

A Reasoner for the Description Logic DL4xD based on the set-theoretic fragment 4LQS^R.

This is the project page of DL4xD-Reasoner, a KE-tableau-based implementation of a reasoner for a decidable fragment of stratified set theory expressing the description logic DL4xD. Our solution solves the main TBox and ABox reasoning problems for DL4xD. In particular, it solves the consistency problem for DL4xD-knowledge bases represented in set-theoretic terms, and a generalization of the Conjunctive
Query Answering problem in which conjunctive queries with variables of three sorts are admitted, called Higher-Order Conjunctive Query Answering. The reasoner also solves the classification problem for DL4xD-knowledge bases. The reasoner, implemented in C++, supports DL4xD-knowledge bases serialized in the OWL/XML format for OWL 2 ontologies and admitting rules expressed in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language).
